# Github Profile

## Introduction
This repository contains a Vue.js application that allows users to search for and view GitHub profiles. The application fetches user data from the GitHub API and displays it in a responsive UI.

## Tools used in achieving this application
- Vue.js
- TailwindCSS
- Axios
- GitHub API

## How I achieved this
To build this application, 
- I followed the standard Vue.js development process, which involved creating components for different parts of the UI, including the user profile, user profile card, repository list and other users profile search. 
- I used the GitHub API to fetch user data and displayed it in the appropriate components.

## How the app works
- The app allows users to search for GitHub profiles by entering a username in the search bar. 
- When a user enters a username, the application fetches data from the GitHub API and displays it in the user profile card. 
- The profile card displays the user's bio, repositories, and followers.
- The app also features a light and dark mode 

## Why I built the project this way
- I chose to build the project with Vue.js because of its simplicity and ease of use. Vue.js is also well-suited for building small to medium-sized applications such as this one. 
- I used the GitHub API to fetch user data because it is a reliable source of information about GitHub profiles.

## If I had more time I would change this
- If I had more time, I would add more features to the application, such as the ability to view a user's contributions and activity on GitHub. 
- I would also improve the UI to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
